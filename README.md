# Movies
Simple ASP.NET MVC Application using Visual Studio 2015 and SQL Server Database.

This project needs a SQL Server Database "Movies" with a table "Movie". To create the database can be used the DDL script found in "Movies\db\Movies.sql", or the backup file "Movies\db\Movies.bak" can be used to restore.
